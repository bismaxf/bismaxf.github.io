## Overview
Created this static recipe website with minimal use of Javascript for desktop orientation as well as for mobile orientation. 



## My process
The process was to first map out all HTML content and after mapping out HTML content, I started tackling the visual aspects through CSS. For small functionalities, I used Javascript and for resposniveness Media Queries and boottrap was used. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Media Queries
- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap
- Javascript


### What I learned

It was a fun project through which I recapped my knowledge of CSS and HTML. The main goal was to use maximum things and to toy with my creative ideas. Apart from that for mobile diaplay, I used media queries to practice adding responsiveness. The major learning point for me was how to tacle the table.
it took me a while to figure out following code snippet:
td:first-child{
    padding-left: 2rem;
    padding-bottom: 0.2rem;
    text-align: left;
}
td:nth-child(2){
     padding-left:2rem;
     text-align:center;
     padding-bottom: 0.2rem;
}
tr{
    border-bottom: solid hsl(30, 18%, 87%);
}
table {
    border-collapse: collapse;
   width:100%;
}
